# volutus.github.io

This base repo runs my root github.io domain, so it contains a mess of different links that may be useful 

## [Coffee](/coffee)

Info on coffee brewing. Mostly recipes / methods stored as markdown 

## [NHL Playoffs](/nhl-playoff-machine)

An abandoned project for creating an NHL playoff machine with its [own repo](https://github.com/volutus/nhl-playoff-machine). Maybe I'll un-abandon it someday?
