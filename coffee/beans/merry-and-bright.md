Light seasonal blend with notable acidity from the tasting notes.

## V60

Grind size: 14 (Timemore C2)

I've made this blend many times and 14 seems to be the right grind. It produces a strong but non-bitter coffee with some sweet notes, which matches the profile.

Since this is a seasonal blend, it's unlikely that these notes will be incredibly helpful but it's been good practice with making consistent pourover.
