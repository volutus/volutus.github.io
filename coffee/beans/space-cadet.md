# [Atomic Roasters - Space Cadet](https://atomicroastery.com/products/space-cadet)

Medium roast blend intended for cold brew with mostly dark notes.

## V60

Grind size: 18 (Timemore C2)

> I started at 16 but it was quite bitter, so I went up to 18 which was still strong but far more muted on the bitterness. This seems like the right grind size for pourover on this coffee after testing.

[Follow standard V60 method](../methods/v60)

## Cold Brew

I haven't tried cold brew for this yet, but I think it would be a perfect candidate. 

Grind size: 24-26 (Timemore C2)
