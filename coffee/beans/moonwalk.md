# [Atomic Roasters - Moonwalk](https://atomicroastery.com/products/moonwalk)

Medium-light roast with sweet and acidic characteristics.

## V60

Grind size: 15 (Timemore C2)

> I noticed some sour notes at 15 hinting at under-extraction, but that's relatively fine for pourover. Maybe try 14 to see if it works better, but I think 15 is about right.
