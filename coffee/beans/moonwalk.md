Medium-light roast with sweet and acidic characteristics.

## V60

Grind size: 13-14 (Timemore C2)

I've done this brew several times and I think that going as low as 13 is okay here. The roast is pretty light so I'm not getting any bitter notes, even with this fine of a grind.

Note that going this fine will increase the brew time since it takes longer to get through the extraction.
