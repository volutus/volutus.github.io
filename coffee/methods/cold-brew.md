# Cold Brew 

## Hario Mizudashi

```
Base Ratio: 90g coffee / ~1150mL water
Grind: 22 on Timemore C2
```

I opted to use some leftover Starbucks blend that was in the back of the cabinet for this since it uses a tremendous amount of coffee, even with a light ratio.

It seems like most cold brew instructions use similar proportions to french press, but the initial recipe seems pretty wasteful compared to a full immersion brew or pourover.

> Thoughts: It's definitely different than making hot coffee over ice, but I'm thinking it largely isn't worth the effort since it uses a lot of beans for the end result.
