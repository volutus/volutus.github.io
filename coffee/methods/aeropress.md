# AeroPress Brew Method

## Notes 

I've mostly built this myself. I've favored the idea of inverting the brewer and doing a long immersion brew.

This seems to give the most versatility for the XL which is susceptible to a large amount of passthrough. 

Additionally, the control cap accessories don't exist for this model so you have no good way to prevent this.

## Ratios 

60g coffee / 1000mL water

> Standard recipe: 27g coffee / 450mL water 

## Prep 

- Grind coffee to desired precision

## Brew 

- Insert plunger into AeroPress chamber, ensuring you've gone far enough to seal the chamber
- Invert mechanism upside down so there's a chamber with the rubber seal at the bottom
- Dump grounds into chamber and shake to balance 
- Pour water onto grounds and give a brief stir to integrate 
- Cover with filter cap. *Do not put the filter in yet*

- Lightly swirl to disturb coffee bed
